Rendered Reality: Real-Time Perceptual Layer
A next-gen spatial computing engine that blends real-world inputs with augmented overlays—creating immersive, responsive environments driven by live data streams. Unlike traditional AR, Rendered Reality adapts dynamically to sensor, camera, and contextual signals to render actionable visualizations in real time.

🚀 Project Goals
- Build a real-time perceptual engine that fuses physical inputs with digital augmentation
- Enable seamless integration with edge devices, IoT sensors, and camera feeds
- Deliver low-latency, high-fidelity overlays for industrial, retail, and experiential use cases
- Architect for modular deployment across mobile, web, and XR platforms
